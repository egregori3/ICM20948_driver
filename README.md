# ICM20948 Initialization
The initialization is a port from the Sparkfun Python driver for the ICM20948 IMU
https://github.com/sparkfun/Qwiic_9DoF_IMU_ICM20948_Py/blob/master/qwiic_icm20948.py
along with the ICM20948 datasheet.

The initialization for the Accel and Gyro is very simple. Set a reset bit and wait.
The IMU defaults to to the accel and Gyro running in a continuous mode.

"The ICM-20948 is a multi-chip module (MCM) consisting of two dies integrated into a single QFN package. One die
houses a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, and a Digital Motion Processorâ„¢ (DMP). The other die houses the
AK09916 3-axis magnetometer from Asahi Kasei Microdevices Corporation. The ICM-20948 is a 9-axis MotionTracking
device all in a small 3x3x1mm QFN package"
